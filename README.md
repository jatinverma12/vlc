# Description
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

VLC is a popular libre and open source media player and multimedia engine,
used by a large number of individuals, professionals, companies and
institutions. Using open source technologies and libraries, VLC has been
ported to most computing platforms, including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X,
BSD, iOS and Android.
VLC can play most multimedia files, discs, streams, allows playback from
devices, and is able to convert to or stream in various formats.
The VideoLAN project was started at the university Ã‰cole Centrale Paris who
relicensed VLC under the GPLv2 license in February 2001. Since then, VLC has
been downloaded close to one billion times.
